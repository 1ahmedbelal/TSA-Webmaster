      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Oxford Community Resource Hub was created by the
        <strong>Oxford High School TSA Webmaster team</strong> for the 2026 TSA competition.
        Our goal is to make it easier for residents to find local support services,
        non-profit organizations, and community programs in one place.
      </p>

      <p>
        While we are students, we designed this site with community members in mind:
        clear navigation, simple language, and mobile-friendly pages that can be
        accessed on phones, tablets, and computers.
      </p>

      <h3>How We Built It</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external frameworks).</li>
        <li>An interactive directory that filters resources by category, cost, and who they serve.</li>
        <li>A public suggestion form so neighbors can recommend new resources.</li>
        <li>Accessibility-conscious design with high contrast, clear headings, and keyboard-friendly navigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        To request an update or report an error, please contact the Oxford High School TSA chapter
        advisor or use the suggestion form on this site.
